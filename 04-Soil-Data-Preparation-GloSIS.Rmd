# Soil Data Preparation 
## Introduction
## Data cleaning
##	Soil Data Harmonization
##	Concepts on digital exchange of soil-related data (ISO 28258)
The GloSIS database schema is aligned with the concepts on digital exchange of soil-related data on the ISO-28258.
ISO-28258 organizes soil-related data into six main categories, known as "features of interest," each with specific subcategories:


- `Site` – Represents the broader environment where soil investigations occur, capturing terrain or land-use characteristics.

- `Plot` – A specific location for soil investigation, where soil profiles and samples are collected. It is further classified into:
  - `Surface` – A polygonal area where soil properties are assumed homogeneous.
  - `TrialPit` – A manually excavated pit for detailed soil examination.
  - `Borehole` – A drilled hole for subsurface soil sampling.

- `Profile` – A vertical sequence of soil horizons or layers at a given location.

- `Element` – Subdivisions of a profile based on depth, further categorized as:
  - `Horizon` – A natural, homogeneous soil layer.
  - `Layer` – An arbitrarily defined soil section, often for analysis.

- `Specimen` – A physical sample extracted at a defined depth, typically analyzed in laboratories for chemical and physical properties.

### **Installation and Setup**

The **GloSIS database** services are provided as **Docker containers**, which allows users to deploy and manage the system without manually installing software dependencies. This approach ensures stability, compatibility, and easy updates.  

**Docker Compose** is a tool used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It allows users to **orchestrate multiple services** using a single configuration file ( see Section **The docker-compose.yml file**). The key benefits of Docker Compose include:

-  **Simplified Deployment** – Automatically pulls and runs multiple containers with a single command.  
-  **Predefined Configuration** – Ensures all services are correctly configured and work together.  
-  **Portability** – The same configuration can be used across different systems without installation issues.  

The system consists of two main **services**, both running as Docker containers:  

1. **`glosis-db`** – A **GloSIS harmonized PostgreSQL database** that stores soil data following the **ISO 28258** standard.  
2. **`glosis-shiny`** – A **Shiny web application** providing a graphical interface to inject structured Excel files into the database.  

These services are **built from pre-configured Docker images** and automatically deployed as containers using **Docker Compose**, meaning all dependencies are pre-configured, ensuring a consistent and reproducible execution across different operating systems.  

This section provides step-by-step instructions to set up the **GloSIS database**, including the installation of **Docker Desktop**, **PostgreSQL**, and **R**. The setup process is **containerized using Docker**, 


#### Install Docker Desktop

Before proceeding, **Docker Desktop** must be installed in your computer.

##### Windows

1. Enable **Hyper-V**
Docker Desktop requires Hyper-V as well as the Hyper-V Module for Windows PowerShell to be installed and enabled. In most systems, the Docker Desktop installer enables it for you.

  To test if Hyper-V is enabled, go to the start menu and type:
  
  ```bash
  Turn Windows features on or off
  ```
  and press enter. In the subsequent screen, verify that Hyper-V is enabled.
  
  To install Hyper-V manually, see [Install Hyper-V on Windows 10](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/Install-Hyper-V?pivots=windows-server). A reboot is required after installation. If you install Hyper-V without rebooting, Docker Desktop does not work correctly.
  
  In some Windows systems [Virtualization](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1) must be enabled in the BIOS. Note that many Windows devices already have virtualization enabled, so this may not apply.

2. Download **Docker Desktop for Windows** from the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. After installation, restart your computer.
5. Open **Docker Desktop** and ensure it is running.

##### MacOS
1. Download **Docker Desktop for Mac** from the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag **Docker** into the Applications folder.
3. Start **Docker Desktop** and allow any requested system permissions.

##### Linux
1. Open a terminal and run the following commands:
   
```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io -y
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
```
Add your user to the Docker group (to run Docker without sudo):

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```


Restart your computer and verify Docker is running:

```bash
docker --version
```
If the installation was successful, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Docker version 24.0.5, build 123456
```


#### Install the GloSIS database services
The easiest way to install the GloSIS database services is by pulling pre-built Docker images available in the GloSIS docker hub.

**Steps**

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running.

2. Download the [GloSIS repository from GitHub](https://github.com/FAO-SID/Glosis-App):

3. Go to:

```bash
`https://github.com/FAO-SID/Glosis-App`.
```

4. Click the green `"Code"` button, then select Download ZIP (Figure \@ref(fig:clone).  

```{r clone, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%",fig.cap = "Clonning the repository."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/clone.png")
```


5. Extract the *ZIP* file to a folder on your computer (e.g. in the `Desktop` folder).

6. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the extracted folder:

```bash
cd Desktop/Glosis-App
```
7. Start the GloSIS services by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The first time you run this command, it may take a few minutes to download all required images.


#### Verify Installation

- Using Docker Desktop
Open Docker Desktop and check if the containers are running (Figure \@ref(fig:docker-desktop)).

```{r docker-desktop, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%",fig.cap = "Docker desktop."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/docker_desktop.png")
```

If everything is working, the project and service icons should be green.
If any service fails, the icon will appear orange (Figure \@ref(fig:docker-fail)).

```{r docker-fail, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%",fig.cap = "Failure on some docker desktop service."}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("figures/docker_fail.png")
```

- Using the Terminal
To manually check if the services are running, type:

```bash
docker ps
```
You should see an output similar to:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          STATUS          PORTS
973bf939       luislado/glosis-shiny:latest   Up 2 minutes    0.0.0.0:3838->3838/tcp
4fd00c73       luislado/glosis-postgis:latest Up 2 minutes    0.0.0.0:5442->5432/tcp
```
To stop the services at any time, use: 

```bash
docker-compose down
```
This will stop and remove the containers, but your database data will remain intact in the data/postgis directory.


## Accessing the Services

**Shiny Web Application:**
To open the `glosis-shiny` service, enter this address in your web browser:

```bash
http://localhost:3838/
```

This will load the interface where you can upload and inject soil data from .xlsx files (Figure \@ref(fig:glosis-shiny)).

```{r glosis-shiny, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%",fig.cap = "GloSIS shiny service."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/glosis_shiny.png")
```

**GloSIS database:**
The GloSIS database is available to connect with other applications such as pgAdmin, DBeaver,QGIS, R, etc, at:

```bash
localhost:5442
```
The user and password for the connection is 'glosis' by default.

With this setup, users can easily run and manage the GloSIS database service and its Shiny web interface while ensuring stability and avoiding conflicts with other PostgreSQL installations.
