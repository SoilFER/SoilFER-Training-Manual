# Presentation and basics {-}

##	Background and Objective {-}
Healthy and productive soils are fundamental to resilient agrifood systems, sustainable land management, and climate adaptation. Yet, in many regions, soil information remains fragmented, outdated, or inaccessible. The Soil Mapping for Resilient Agrifood Systems (SoilFER) programme responds to this challenge by building comprehensive soil information systems that integrate sampling design, laboratory analysis, soil spectroscopy, digital modeling, and decision support tools. These systems aim to empower governments, researchers, and farmers with actionable knowledge for crop selection, fertilizer recommendations, and soil health management. 

This manual, provides a step-by-step guide along the entire soil data value chain. It is designed as both a technical reference and a practical training resource, bridging the gap between raw soil data and its functional use in agricultural and environmental decision-making. 

The objectives of this manual are to: 

* Present harmonized approaches for soil sampling design used under the SoilFER programme

* Provide guidance on the integration soil spectroscopy estimated soil parameters into the digital soil mapping process

* Introduce best practices in soil data preparation and management, aligned with the Global Soil Information System (GloSIS)

* Demonstrate methods for digital soil modeling and mapping, covering classical statistics, machine learning, and hybrid inference for both continuous and categorical soil properties. 

* Explain how to generate functional soil information to support evidence-based decision-making. 

* Facilitate data sharing and dissemination, promoting open standards, metadata documentation, and web-based services. 

By integrating these components, the manual equips users to move from raw samples to reliable soil information products that inform policy, guide sustainable soil management, and strengthen food and nutrition security. 

## How to use this book {-}

This manual is designed to be used **hands-on**. Each chapter combines conceptual explanations with practical exercises that rely on scripts, tabular datasets, and spatial data. To follow the workflows as intended, participants are expected to work locally with the predefined project structure used throughout the SoilFER training.

### Required downloads {-}

All training materials are distributed across **two complementary sources**.

1. Scripts and lightweight tabular data (GitHub)

The GitHub repository contains:

- All scripts used throughout the manual  
- Lightweight tabular datasets  
- The full project folder structure, organised by module  

Download the repository as a ZIP file from:  
[https://github.com/SoilFER/SoilFER-Training-Resources](https://github.com/SoilFER/SoilFER-Training-Resources/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. Large input datasets (Google Drive)

The Google Drive folder contains files that are too large to be hosted on GitHub, including:

- Raster covariates and maps  
- Large spectral datasets  
- Other supporting input data used in selected modules  

Download the data from:  
[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K7tq9zX5HsqbqWcNoT27WtfPtehcKBCu](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K7tq9zX5HsqbqWcNoT27WtfPtehcKBCu?usp=drive_link)

### Step-by-step setup instructions {-}

Follow these steps **in order** before starting any module exercises.

#### Step 1: Download and extract the GitHub repository {-} 

1. Download the ZIP file from the GitHub link above.  
2. Extract (unzip) the contents on your local machine.  
3. Rename the extracted folder if needed (e.g. `SoilFER-Training-Resources`).  
4. Use this folder as your **main project directory**.

#### Step 2: Download the Google Drive data {-}

1. Download the full contents of the Google Drive folder.  
2. Keep all file names and folder structures unchanged.  
3. Do **not** work directly from the downloaded Google Drive folder.

#### Step 3: Inspect the project folder structure {-}

1. Open the extracted project directory.  
2. Confirm that the top-level structure matches the following:

```text
SoilFER-Training-Resources/
├── 01_data/
│   ├── module1/
│   ├── module2/
│   ├── module3/
│   ├── module4/
│   ├── module5/
│   └── module6/
├── 02_scripts/
├── 03_outputs/
├── 04_assignments/
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

Verify that each subfolder under `01_data/` corresponds to a module in this manual.

#### Step 4: Place Google Drive files into the correct module folders {-}

1. Locate the downloaded Google Drive data on your computer.

2. Copy the entire `rasters/` folder into:

   01_data/module2/

3. Copy the file `MIR_KANSAS_data.xlsx` into:

   01_data/module3/

4. Confirm that the folders now resemble:
```text
   01_data/  
   ├── module2/  
   │   ├── shapes/  
   │   ├── rasters/  
   │   └── README.md  
   ├── module3/  
   │   ├── MIR_KANSAS_data.xlsx  
   │   └── README.md  
```
> **Important:**  
> All Google Drive files must be placed *inside* the appropriate `01_data/moduleX/` folders.  
> Scripts rely on relative paths and will not run correctly if files are stored elsewhere.
