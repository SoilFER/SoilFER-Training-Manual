Yet, in many regions, soil information remains fragmented, outdated, or inaccessible. The Soil Mapping for Resilient Agrifood Systems (SoilFER) programme responds to this challenge by building comprehensive soil information systems that integrate sampling design, laboratory analysis, soil spectroscopy, digital modeling, and decision support tools. These systems aim to empower governments, researchers, and farmers with actionable knowledge for crop selection, fertilizer recommendations, and soil health management. This manual, Integrated Soil Information for Decision-Making: From Soil Sampling Design and Spectroscopy to Decisions, provides a step-by-step guide along the entire soil data value chain. It is designed as both a technical reference and a practical training resource, bridging the gap between raw soil data and its functional use in agricultural and environmental decision-making. The objectives of this manual are to: Present harmonized approaches for soil sampling design, ensuring representative and high-quality soil data collection. Provide guidance on soil laboratory analyses, with a focus soil spectroscopy, including calibration, preprocessing, modeling, and validation. Introduce best practices in soil data preparation and management, aligned with the Global Soil Information System (GloSIS) data model. Demonstrate methods for digital soil modeling and mapping, covering classical statistics, machine learning, and hybrid inference for both continuous and categorical soil properties. Explain how to generate functional soil information, including soil nutrient budgets, uncertainty maps, and probability surfaces, to support evidence-based decision-making. Facilitate data sharing and dissemination, promoting open standards, metadata documentation, and web-based services. By integrating these components, the manual equips users to move from raw samples to reliable soil information products that inform policy, guide sustainable soil management, and strengthen food and nutrition security. 1.2 How to use this book The present document is a technical manual on the phase I of the GSNmap initiative. It provides the scientific background on the importance of soil nutrients and guidance on the digital soil mapping techniques to map nutrients and soil properties that govern nutrient availability. It also comprises a compendium with all necessary scripts to generate national GSNmaps. These scripts are described step-by-step in 4 steps that cover soil data preparation (Step 1), covariate download (Step 2), the mapping process itself (Step 3), and the automatic generation of national reports (Step 4). The general workflow is shown in Figure 1.1. Figure 1.1: Overview of the steps to follow for the GSNmap generation. The chapters are structured as following: Chapter 1 Lorem ipsum Chapter 2 Lorem ipsum Chapter 3 Lorem ipsum Chapter 5 Lorem ipsum Chapter 6 Lorem ipsum Annex I serves as a repository for the complete scripts compendium Annex II provides alternative step-by-step instructions for the special case of soil data without point coordinates. 1.3 Training material The train material of this book is located in the Link . 1.4 Setting up the software environment 1.5 Resources to get started 1.4.1.
